# Agora's NEAR Deployment Guides

These guides define a secure, repeatable process to deploy the House of Stake (HoS) contracts on NEAR and operate high‑value contracts safely. These documents come from Agora's own problems and hiccups when deploying the HoS contracts on NEAR coming from an EVM background.

After consulting with key members of the NEAR ecosystem including the Lane Rettig of the NF, Gauntlet, Illia, and the original contract authors, [FastNEAR](https://fastnear.com/), we contracted [Halborn](https://www.halborn.com/) to create an audited and attested security guide and runbooks for deploying high‑value contracts in the NEAR ecosystem.

Agora then adapted it to create the specific House of Stake deployment guide.

## Goals of this repo

Our goal is that the community can use these documents to as a reference when deploying the HoS contracts and other high‑value contracts in the NEAR ecosystem.

We also hope that they serve as a comminity reference for other best practices until there is a better place for them in the official NEAR docs, or repos. 

## Who this is for

These documents are generally for anyone in the NEAR ecosystem that is deploying high‑value contracts or interested in understanding the security considerations and best practices for deploying high‑value contracts in the NEAR ecosystem.

## What is in this repo

The [House of Stake Deployment Guide](./agora-house-of-stake-deployment-guide.md) is specifically for members of the House of Stake Security Council and the House of Stake team as they will be the ones deploying the HoS contracts on NEAR and working with Agora and other teams to deploy upgrades and migrations.

The [High‑Value Contract Security Guide (Halborn)](./halborn-high-value-contract-security-guide.md) is specifically for anyone in the NEAR ecosystem that is deploying high‑value contracts or interested in understanding the security considerations and best practices for deploying contracts in the NEAR ecosystem securely.

Pull requests are welcome to improve these documents as more teams deploy and operate other high‑value contracts in the NEAR ecosystem.
